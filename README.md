## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Clearer understanding of height and how child element inherit percentage from the parent element
- Difference between min-height and height of an element
- Border-box propety does not take into account the margin of the element, only includes the content, padding and border
- Use flex-grow to allow a flex element grow to occupy any remaining space of its flex container

### Continued development

- Experiment with other ways of making a webpage responsive e.g. min(), max(), clamp()
- Learn how to use CSS aspect-ratio property
- Explore the different functions of classes

### Useful resources

- [HTML Page Width and Height Settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpuKVjX6BJ8) - This helped me better understand how height works for html and body elements, and the correct ways of manipulating them

## Acknowledgments

Practice is a very important learning stage in coding, and I want to thank [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for making it easier for me to do that. With their help, I can focus on understanding the different properties in HTML and CSS with my minimal knowledge on UI and UX design.
